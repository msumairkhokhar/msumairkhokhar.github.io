                            continues until data completed. Developed a website for displaying and managing fetched data and it can be exported

                            Developed a PHP module on a windows server with an existing VB.Net project. The scope of this module is to manage

                            There is 3 in 3 out formula implemented to sell and buy seeds for every member in 3 waves. The seeds are actually
                            a virtual value calculated by the game tokens and invested amount of the member.<br/>
                            The mechanism of the seeds trading are just like stock exchange shares trading. One person can sell their seeds and
                            the other person can buy depending upon availability in selling queue. Program maintains the full transaction
                            history of every level of selling and buying. Very complex algorithms and mathematical calculations are developed.

                            Developed an iOS App for Antlere (Portal) to access the core information from server.<br/>
                            One-time login required and app will remain logged in until it will be uninstalled from memory or logout by user.
                            When navigate to any page then application will fetch data from live server according to the filters values.
                            User can set global filters of specific campaign, channel and date ranges for fetching data from server.
                            Graphs and reports represents data which are designed in application. All graphs and reports work with live server
                            data, when there are no data graphs will not appear. The application requires internet connection for syncing data
                            from server. Offline app will maintain last fetched data so when internet connection is not available then pages
                            will show last synced data. A sync button on right top corner of every page reloads the page and get latest data.
